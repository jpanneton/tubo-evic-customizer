# Tubo Evic Customizer

This simple tool allows you to visualize different Tubo Evic designs easily. Note that results might vary in real life, and that this tool should only be used to give you an idea about the final product.

## Export your design

On the bottom of the page, the Copy URL button will generate a custom URL with all the current parameters and copy it to clipboard. When using this URL, all the settings you defined will be loaded automatically. This feature makes it really easy to share your design with others. Also, you can generate a PNG image of your design with the Download PNG button. Since the image is opened in a new tab, you can open a few of them with different settings and switch between them to compare your designs easily.

## Browser compatibility notes

Note that color sliders are not displayed exactly in the same way on Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. I highly suggest you to use Chrome or Firefox for the best user experience. Also, this website has no mobile version, so it might be hard to use on some smaller devices.
